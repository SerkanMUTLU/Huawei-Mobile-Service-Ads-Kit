Native Ads : Native ads are typical ad materials that are displayed on the customized interface of an app so that they can fit seamlessly into the surrounding content in the app. 

Banner Ads : Banner ads are rectangular images that occupy a spot at the top, middle, or bottom within an app’s layout. Banner ads refresh automatically at intervals. When a user taps a banner ad, the user is redirected to the advertiser’s page in most cases. 

Rewarded Ads : Rewarded ads are full-screen video ads that users opt to view in exchange for in-app rewards. 

Interstitial ads : Interstitial ads are full-screen ads that cover the interface of an app. Such ads are displayed when a user starts, pauses, or exits an app, without disrupting the user’s experience. 

Splash ads : Splash ads are displayed immediately after an app is launched, even before the home screen of the app is displayed.
